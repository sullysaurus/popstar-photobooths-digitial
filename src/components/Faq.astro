    },
    {
        question: "What if my guests want physical prints?",
        answer: "We recommend including the high-quality digital photos with your thank you cards - it's a delightful surprise that guests love! You can also print any photos you want after the event at a fraction of the cost."

        question: "Do you provide props?",
        answer: "We can guide you to purchase brand new props at half the cost of what most companies charge for used ones. This ensures you have fresh, clean props that you can keep after your event."
